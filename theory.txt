1) What is the Async programming in C#?

The core of async programming is the Task and Task<T> objects, which model asynchronous operations. 
They are supported by the async and await keywords. The model is fairly simple in most cases:
- For I/O-bound code, you await an operation that returns a Task or Task<T> inside of an async method.
- For CPU-bound code, you await an operation that is started on a background thread with the Task.Run method.

The await keyword yields control to the caller of the method that performed await, 
and it ultimately allows a UI to be responsive or a service to be elastic. 

2) What are the key operators that are used for asynchronous operation? 

Async - specify that a method, lambda expression, or anonymous method is asynchronous.
Await - suspends evaluation of the enclosing async method until the asynchronous operation represented by its operand completes.
When the asynchronous operation completes, the await operator returns the result of the operation, if any. 

3) If you mark a method with the async keyword, does this mean that the method is executed asynchronously?

No.To be executed asynchronously a method must contain an await expression. 
Async signals to the compiler that the method can be awaited and the compiler creates a state machine for the method.

4) What Asynchronous programming patterns do you know?

 - Task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP) - based on Task and Task<TResult>.
 TAP uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation. 
 Asynchronous methods in TAP include the Async suffix after the operation name for methods that return awaitable types, 
 such as Task, Task<TResult>, ValueTask, and ValueTask<TResult>.
 - Event-based asynchronous pattern - prescribes one way for classes to present asynchronous behavior.
 A class that supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern will have one or more methods named MethodNameAsync. 
 These methods may mirror synchronous versions, which perform the same operation on the current thread. 
 The class may also have a MethodNameCompleted event and it may have a MethodNameAsyncCancel (or simply CancelAsync) method.
- Asynchronous programming model (APM) - asynchronous operations are implemented as two methods named BeginOperationName and EndOperationName
After calling BeginOperationName, an application can continue executing instructions on the calling thread while the asynchronous operation takes place on a different thread. 
For each call to BeginOperationName, the application should also call EndOperationName to get the results of the operation.

5) Can a method contain multiple “await” key operators?

Yes.

6) What types can be returned?

Task, Task<Tresult>, ValueTask, ValueTask<TResult>, void (for event handlers), IAsyncEnumerable<T>
and any type that has an accessible GetAwater method hat returns an instance of an awaiter type.
